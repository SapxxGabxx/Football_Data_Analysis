# Shots_Analysis_Euro2020 ⚽
I want to see how many shots each team has made in Russia-Denmark Euro 2020 match. 🗒️

You can do the same with other matches by exploiting the code. 📈

I want to know how huge the chance for scoring a goal is. 📉

This chances are the expected goals. 📊

For this study I used the data of StatsBomb Open Data repository. 📅

For creating the soccer field, I used the createPitch function from the FCPython file.
