# Shots_Analysis_Euro2020 ⚽
I want to see how many shots each team has made in each match. 📈

I want to know how huge the chance for scoring a goal is. 📉

This chances are the expected goals. 📊

For this study I used the data of StatsBomb Open Data repository. 📅

For creating the soccer field, I used the createPitch function from the FCPython file.
